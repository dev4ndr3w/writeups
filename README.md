# writeups

**July 7, 2020**

Life is short.

I decided don't spend my time for writing write-ups of wargame any more. In the case of wargame, I will upload only an exploitation code and necessary information about solving the challenge.

Instead of focusing on solving wargame, I will focus on learning or researching more for participating in CTF for improving hacking skills.

Of course, When I solving some CTF, that write-up will be upload in this repository.
