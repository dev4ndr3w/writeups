# writeups

**July 7, 2020**

Life is short.

I decided not to spend my time for writing write-ups of wargame any more. In the case of wargame, I will upload only an exploitation code and necessary information about solving the challenge.

Instead of focusing on solving wargame, I will focus on improving hacking skills for make a good result in CTF.

Of course, when I solve some CTF, that write-up will be uploaded in this repository.
